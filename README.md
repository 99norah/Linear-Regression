## Introduction:
This is the second project for the T5 Data Science Bootcamp, which is about building a linear regression model that address a useful prediction using Scikit-learn, and using data scraped from website with Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium. This project helps ReadMe firm which is an online web site that is selling books. In order to determine the price of its products they ask for our help as data scientists to study the books features to predict a suitable price.
